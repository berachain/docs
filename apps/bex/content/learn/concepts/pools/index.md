# Pools

BeraSwap pools contain the logic and math for swapping tokens and for liquidity operations. There are several types of pools, each with its own unique characteristics and use cases.

## Pool Types

- [**Weighted Pools**](/learn/concepts/pools/weighted-pools): pools with custom weights for each token, generally for uncorrelated assets
- [**Stable Pools**](/learn/concepts/pools/stable-pools): pools for pegged tokens (e.g. to USD) or correlated tokens with a known exchange rate
