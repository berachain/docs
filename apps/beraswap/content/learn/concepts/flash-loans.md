# Flash Loans

:::warning
Flash loans are currently disabled in BeraSwap through protocol fees. This feature may be enabled in the future through governance.
:::

## What are Flash Loans?

Flash loans are a DeFi primitive that allows users to borrow any amount of assets without providing collateral, as long as the loan is repaid within the same transaction.

## Future Availability

While flash loans technically exist in the current implementation, their use is rendered impractical due to a high fee setting. The ability to enable flash loans in the future lies with BeraSwap governance.
