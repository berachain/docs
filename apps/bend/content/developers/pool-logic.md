# Pool Contract

At the center of Bend is the [Pool smart contract](/developers/contracts/pool). This smart contract serves as the **main user facing contract** of the protocol and it coordinates with subsidiary logic contracts to carry out the execution. The main user functions of `Pool.sol` are illustrated below:

## Core Functions

The core functions of Bend are separated into two categories, and governed by distinct logic contracts:

1. Supply - governed by `SupplyLogic.sol`
2. Borrow - governed by `BorrowLogic.sol`

**Supply** - relates to suppliers **providing** and **removing liquidity** from the protocol. `aTokens`, which represent users' entitlement to withdraw their supplied liquidity, are minted and burned during liquidity provision and removal, respectively.

**Borrow** - refers to borrowers **borrowing** and **repaying loans**. `DebtTokens`, which represent the users' outstanding debt, are minted and burned during borrowing and repayment, respectively.

### Pool Interactions

The below diagram illustrates how Poolâ€™s main functions interact with lower level functions.

> **Note:** the `Pool ` contract mainly makes these subsequent calls to internal functions (e.g. `executeSupply()` within `SupplyLogic.sol`).

## Other Pool Functions

### Liquidation

Liquidations are crucial for ensuring the solvency of Bend and to avoid users from the protocol accruing bad debt. Liquidations are controlled by the `LiquidationLogic` contract.

Developers may consult the [Liquidations Guide](/developers/guides/liquidate-loan) for more information on executing liquidations.
