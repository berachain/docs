# AToken Contract Interface

aTokens are tokens minted and burnt upon supply and withdraw of assets to Bend, which denote the amount of crypto assets supplied and the yield earned on those assets. aTokensâ€™ value is pegged to the value of the corresponding supplied asset at a 1:1 ratio and can be safely stored, transferred or traded. All yield collected by the aTokens' reserves are distributed to aToken holders directly by continuously increasing their wallet balance (i.e. rebasing).

All standard EIP20 methods are implemented for aTokens, such as `balanceOf`, `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, `totalSupply` etc.

### mint

```solidity
function mint(address caller, address onBehalfOf, uint256 amount, uint256 index) external virtual returns (bool)
```

Mints `amount` aTokens to `user`

#### Parameters

| Name       | Type    | Description                                                  |
| ---------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| caller     | address | The address performing the mint                              |

### burn

```solidity
function burn(address from, address receiverOfUnderlying, uint256 amount, uint256 index) external virtual

if the amount to burn is less than the interest that the user accrued_

function UNDERLYING_ASSET_ADDRESS() external view returns (address)
```

Returns the address of the underlying asset of this aToken (E.g. WETH for aWETH)

### transferUnderlyingTo

```solidity
function transferUnderlyingTo(address target, uint256 amount) external virtual

Transfers the underlying asset to `target`.

_Used by the Pool to transfer assets in borrow(), withdraw() and flashLoan()_

### handleRepayment

```solidity
function handleRepayment(address user, address onBehalfOf, uint256 amount) external virtual

_The default implementation is empty as with standard ERC20 tokens, nothing needs to be done after the
transfer is concluded. However in the future there may be aTokens that allow for example to stake the underlying
to receive LM rewards. In that case, `handleRepayment()` would perform the staking of the underlying asset._
