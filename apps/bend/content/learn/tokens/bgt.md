# Bend & $BGT

The Berachain Governance Token `$BGT` is the native governance token that is typically rewarded to direct delegators and specific liquidity providers (LPs), through pools when a validator proposes a new block, is awarded some `$BGT`, and distributes that `$BGT` to specific delegators and liquidity pools.

`$BGT` is non-transferable, can only be awarded through validators, can be staked with validators, used in governance proposals, and can be burned for `$BERA` - the native Berachain gas token.

## Earning $BGT

`$BGT` can be accumulated only via keeping open borrow positions on Bend.

Reward vaults are created after pools are whitelisted, which users can deposit in to earn $BGT. To learn more about guages check out our core docs on [Bend & Proof Of Liquidity](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/pol/rewardvaults#reward-vaults).

Here are a few examples of how $BGT is earned across Berachain's native DApps:

- Depositing liquidity in the native Bex for an LP pair that is earning `$BGT` emissions.
- Borrowing `$HONEY` on Bend.
- Providing `$HONEY` in the `HONEY` vault for Berps.

## What can you do with $BGT?

### Governance

`$BGT` is used to vote on governance proposals. `$BGT` holders are responsible for a wide variety of ecosystem decisions, discussed in [Governance](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/governance/). `$BGT` holders can either vote on proposals themselves or delegate their voting power to any other address. This governance delegation operates independently of delegating to validators for controlling `$BGT` emissions.

### Earning Incentives

Protocols can provide [Incentives](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/protocol/incentives) to attract `$BGT` emissions from validators. The amount that validators can earn in protocol incentives is determined by the amount of `$BGT` that is delegated to them. Thus, validators that return the maximum value to their `$BGT` delegators are likely to receive the most delegations.

### Burning for `$BERA`

`$BGT` can be burned 1:1 for `$BERA`. This is a one-way function, and `$BERA` cannot be converted into `$BGT`. This limits the ability to earn the chain's economic incentives solely to `$BGT` holders.
