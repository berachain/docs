# aToken Overview

**aTokens** are tokens minted and burnt upon supply and withdraw of assets to a Bend market.

Users receive a corresponding amount of aTokens in return when depositing a token, e.g., deposit `$HONEY` and get `a$HONEY`. These aTokens represent the user’s share of the total pool deposit and accrue interest over time.

Users can hold, transfer, or even use these aTokens as collateral for borrowing additional assets within the Bend ecosystem.

The aTokens effectively serve as interest-bearing receipts or claims on the underlying deposited assets, hence the name “receipt tokens”.
Refer here for documentation.

The value of aToken is pegged to the value of the corresponding supplied asset at a 1:1 ratio and can be safely stored, transferred or traded. All yield collected by the aTokens' reserves is distributed to aToken holders directly by continuously increasing their wallet balance.
