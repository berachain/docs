# Market

A market in lending protocols represents a fundamental lending pool that pairs one collateral asset with one loan asset, creating a venue for lenders and borrowers to interact. Bend leverage's [**Morpho Market V1**](https://docs.morpho.org/learn/concepts/market/#what-is-a-morpho-market-v1) as a base for its functionality.

## What is a Market?

A market is a primitive lending pool that enables users to:

- **Lend assets** and earn interest on their deposits
- **Borrow assets** by providing collateral
- **Trade positions** through various market mechanisms

Each market operates independently with its own parameters, ensuring that risks are contained within individual markets rather than spreading across the entire protocol.

## Key Characteristics

### Isolated Risk

- Each market operates independently
- Risks are contained within individual markets
- No cross-market contamination of losses

### Immutable Parameters

- Market rules are set at creation and cannot be changed
- Provides predictable behavior for participants
- Eliminates systematic risks from parameter changes

### Asset Pairing

- One collateral asset paired with one loan asset
- Clear separation of lending and borrowing activities
- Simplified risk assessment and management

## Market Components

### Core Assets

1. **Collateral Asset**: The asset users deposit to borrow against
2. **Loan Asset**: The asset users can borrow from the market

### Market Parameters

1. [**Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio**](/learn/concepts/market/ltv): Value of loan against collateral
2. **Liquidation Loan-to-Value (LLTV)**: The LTV at which positions become eligible for liquidation
3. [**Interest Rate Model**](/learn/concepts/irm): Formula determining borrowing costs and lending yields
4. [**Oracle**](/learn/concepts/oracle): Price feed for collateral valuation
5. **Market Cap**: Maximum capacity for lending and borrowing

## Market Operations

### For Lenders

:::info
**NOTE:** Users cannot directly supply to a market. Instread they supply to a Vault that is managed by a [Curator](/learn/concepts/curator) that distributes assets among different markets. See [Vault](/learn/concepts/vault) for more information.
:::

- **Supply**: Deposit loan assets to earn interest
- **Withdraw**: Remove supplied assets and accrued interest

### For Borrowers

- **Borrow**: Take out loans against deposited collateral
- **Repay**: Return borrowed assets to reclaim collateral
- **Manage Position**: Monitor health ratio and add/remove collateral

### For Liquidators

- **Liquidate**: Repay debt in exchange for discounted collateral
- **Maintain Market Health**: Ensure borrowers maintain adequate collateralization

## Market Creation

### Permissionless Market Creation

A distinctive feature of Bend is permissionless market creation: the protocol enables users to create isolated markets, each defined by the five key parameters outlined above.

This approach differs from traditional lending platforms, which typically:

- Require governance approval\* for listing new assets or changing market parameters.
- Pool assets into a single lending pool, resulting in shared risk across the protocol.

In Bend, each market is created with its own immutable parametersâ€”selected at the time of creation and persisting for the lifetime of the market. Specifically, the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio and interest rate model must be chosen from a set of options approved by Bend governance. This design ensures risk isolation, flexibility, and the ability to quickly support new asset integrations while maintaining protocol standards.

**NOTE:** For a market to appear on the Bend UI, applicants must submit a proposal to whitelist a vault that include its allocation via <a target="_blank" :href="config.websites.bend.formUrl + '?utm_source=' + config.websites.docsBend.utmSource">{{config.websites.bend.formUrl}}</a>.
