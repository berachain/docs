# Bundlers

Bundlers are smart contracts that allow you to combine multiple actions into a single transaction. Instead of executing several transactions in sequence—each requiring confirmation and gas fees—bundlers let you do everything at once.

## Bundler Implementations

Bundler3 is Morpho's most advanced bundler, integrated directly into the Morpho interface. This means users will be able to perform complex operations with just one click.

## What Bundler3 Allows You To Do

With Bundler3, you can:

1. **Streamline Complex Workflows** - Complete lending, borrowing, swapping, and more in one transaction
2. **Save on Gas Fees** - Pay for one transaction instead of many
3. **Avoid Failed Transactions** - If any part of your operation would fail, the entire transaction reverts safely
4. **Perform Advanced Operations** - Combine actions that normally require multiple steps

## Practical Examples

- **One-Click Leverage**: Convert $BERA to $WETH, deposit as collateral, and borrow $HONEY all in one transaction
- **Instant Refinancing**: Borrow from one market, repay another, and adjust collateral positions simultaneously
- **Portfolio Rebalancing**: Withdraw, swap, and redeposit assets across multiple markets without waiting for confirmations
