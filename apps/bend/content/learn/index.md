# What Is Berachain Bend? 🐻⛓️

Bend is Berachain's non-custodial lending protocol. Bend is centered around providing `$HONEY` utility to the Berachain ecosystem.

Borrowers can supply blue-chip assets as collateral and borrow `$HONEY` whilst earning `$BGT`. Conversely, `$HONEY` holders can deposit their tokens to earn lending interest from borrowers.

Here's an illustration of user interactions with Bend:

Bend's design is inspired by [Aave](https://app.aave.com/), a highly battle-tested and efficient lending protocol.
