# Curator

A **Curator** in the Bend ecosystem is an entity or individual who aims to optimize the risk-adjusted returns for depositors based on a given strategy. Curators are specifically responsible for the strategic curation of vaults, making key decisions about which markets to include, how capital is allocated, and how risk is curated within the vault structure.

For more details about curators, see the [Curator](/learn/concepts/curator) section.

## Curator Application Process

The curator application is a process through which curators can have their vault appear on the UI. The application process involves going through governance, which is ultimately decided by the guardians.
