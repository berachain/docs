# Berps Vault Rewards

A depositer can expect to earn rewards in the form of additional fees accumulated for depositing their `$HONEY` and `$BGT` from staking `$bHONEY`.

## How Much $HONEY Can I Earn?

The `$HONEY` amount earned is proportional to the contribution from the depositer of the total profits earned from the Berps Vault.

## How Do I Earn $BGT?

$BGT is earned through staking `$bHONEY` into a vault, and is distributed over time.

If a validator is directing emissions to the Berps Vault, every `$bHONEY` staker is elligible to receive a portion of that `$BGT`.

## How Do I Claim $BGT

$BGT can be claimed on <a :href="config.testnet.dapps.bgtStation.url">BGT station</a>.
