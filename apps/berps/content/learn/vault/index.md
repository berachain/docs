# Berps Vault

The Berps Vault, or `$bHONEY` Vault, is a [Tokenized Vault](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626) allows users to deposit `$HONEY`, which is then borrowed by traders to create trades.

## bHoney Vault Rewards

Users who deposit can expect to be rewarded in `$HONEY` from any of the fees generated by trades, and/or `$BGT`.

When a user depositors `$HONEY`, they are automatically given a corresponding amount of `$bHONEY` to represent ownership of `$HONEY` in the Berps Vault.

As long as a user has `$bHONEY`, any trading fees will be distributed to to depositors at the time that they withdraw their `$HONEY`, which burns their equivalent in `$bHONEY` previously received.

If a depositor would like to qualify for `$BGT` rewards, they would need to stake their `$bHONEY` into another contract which would qualify them to receive `$BGT` whenever emissions is directed to the Berps Vault.

## Berps Vault & PoL

The Berps Vault is also an elligible reward vault for Validators to distribute `$BGT` emissions to and is one of a few native Berachain dApps elligible at the start to receive `$BGT` emissions.
