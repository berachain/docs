# One-Click Trading (1CT)

One-Click Trading or 1CT is a way to expedite trades by improving the user experience for traders on Berps.

It allows for traders to create a generated EOA wallet within Berps which can be funded and used to execute trades without the need for an EOA wallet to approve every transaction (approvals, confirmations, etc).

## Benefits & Caveats

The main benefits are user-experience and speed of executing trades.

The main caveat is that the EOA wallet is generated within the browser client. It is recommended that once trading is complete the funds are withdrawn.

:::warning
It is highly recommended to copy the generated _Private Keys_ generated to avoid any potential losses of assets.
