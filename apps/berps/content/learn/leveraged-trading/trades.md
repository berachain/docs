## Limit Orders

For **Limit** trades, a trader will typically specify price parameters which will either buy or sell a trade at the point where that limit has been reached.

The difference between Limit and Market is Limit order may not execute right away and allows users to specify a price at which they want to buy or sell.

## Take Profit

An additional parameter that traders can put in place to ensure that their trade sells at a certain profit threshold automatically.

> **NOTE:** Automatically means that the community of liquidation bots will execute the trade for a fee.

## Stop Loss

In addition to Take Profit, a **Stop Loss** can be an additional parameter put in place to prevent the trader from losing their total initial investment and sell off the trade when it reaches a certain threshold for loss automatically.

**NOTE:** Similar to **Limit** orders, only reversal limit orders are supported currently. This means that if a trader wants to go long, they must enter at a price lower than the current price. Similarly if a trader wants to go short, they must enter at a price higher than the current price. This also guarantees a more favorable entry price than the current price.
