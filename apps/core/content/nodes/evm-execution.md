# EVM Execution Layer ‚ü†

The execution layer has multiple implementations in the form of EVM execution clients that handle transactions, transaction gossiping, state management, and support the Ethereum Virtual Machine - they are not responsible for block building.

The following are the execution clients that BeaconKit has tested and verified support for:

| Client                                                          | Language   | Sync Strategies                    | State Pruning   | Maintainer          |
