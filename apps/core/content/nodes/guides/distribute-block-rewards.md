# Distribute Block Rewards

The following steps will guide you through the process of distributing block rewards on Berachain for both Validators and Reward Vaults.

## How Block Rewards Are Distributed

Block rewards are distributed to both a Validator and Reward Vaults defined by the respective Validator's Reward Allocation.

Reward distribution does not happen automatically and requires that the `distributeFor` function be called in the <a :href="config.mainnet.dapps.berascan.url + 'address/' + config.mainnet.contracts.distributor.address" target="_blank">Distributor</a> contract.

## Who Can Distribute Block Rewards?

Anyone can trigger this function, as long as they have access to the proof generation endpoint provided by `beacond`. Anyone can also execute the `distributeFor` function for past blocks.

## Distribution Considerations

There are a few points to consider with distribution:

1. **Distribute At Block N-1** - The Distributor contract can only distribute block rewards for the block that was last created and not the current block.
2. **Block Rewards Expiration** - If rewards are not distributed before a block span of `{{config.mainnet.rewardDistributionBlockExpiration}}`, the rewards are lost.
3. **Foundation Trigger Fallback** - The Berachain foundation has set up a service to call the `distributeFor` function periodically, including sometimes in a `multicall` to ensure that block rewards are distributed. However, this fallback should be considered a last resort, and Validators should plan to set up a service to handle triggering the distribution themselves.
4. **Block Reward Tracking** - It is recommended that node operators track the block rewards they have distributed to ensure that they are not missing any rewards.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A full node synced to the latest block with `beacond` and an execution client
- `$BERA` to process the transaction
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)

## Steps To Distribute Block Rewards Via Foundry

The following is a single bash command that can be run to distribute block rewards.

:::info
**NOTE:** If the transaction fails, it is possible that these block rewards have already been distributed.

# STEP 1: Get Block(s) To Be Distributed
# ----------------------------------------------------
# Get recent finalized block's number from Exec Layer -> Get timestamp of its parent block
# Example: 1730756547

cast block finalized --rpc-url http://localhost:8545;
