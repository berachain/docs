# August 2025 Berachain Upgrade üî±

Our next upgrade brings to Berachain four approved Improvement Proposals.

1. [BRIP-0001 - Execution Layer Forked Clients](https://github.com/berachain/BRIPs/blob/main/meta/BRIP-0001.md)
2. [BRIP-0002 - Gas Fee Modifications](https://github.com/berachain/BRIPs/blob/main/meta/BRIP-0002.md)
3. [BRIP-0003 - Stable Block Time](https://github.com/berachain/BRIPs/blob/main/meta/BRIP-0003.md)
4. [BRIP-0004 - Enshrined PoL Reward Distribution](https://github.com/berachain/BRIPs/blob/main/meta/BRIP-0004.md)

[Bera-Reth](https://github.com/berachain/bera-reth) and [Bera-Geth](https://github.com/berachain/bera-geth) are new forks of ParadymXYZ's reth and Ethereum Foundation's go-ethereum, under the upstream software licenses.

:::warning
All users, whether hosting an RPC or running a validator, **must upgrade** their Execution Client to either Bera-Reth or Bera-Geth, **and** upgrade to Beacon Kit 1.3.0, to continue following the chain.

## Upgrade Details

Berachain will release stand-alone executables and Docker images for Linux ARM and AMD64 architectures for Beacon Kit, Bera-Reth, and Bera-Geth. All clients are easily compiled for other systems and architectures with a few minutes' time; review their respective READMEs for details.

**Executable names** are changed: `geth` ‚Üí `bera-geth` and `reth` ‚Üí `bera-reth`, in our release binaries and Docker images.

Operators currently running Geth or Reth can upgrade to our forked versions while **retaining their current chain data files**. Operators migrating from other clients should sync a new node with a snapshot - [testnet](https://storage.googleapis.com/bera-testnet-snapshot-eu/index.html) or [mainnet](https://storage.googleapis.com/bera-snapshot-eu/index.html).

**New Genesis files** are required for Beacon-Kit and Bera-Reth/Geth, but **no other configuration changes** are needed.

## Upgrade instructions

Test your modifications on non-production infrastructure to verify your upgrade success.

:::tip
If you duplicate your installation to test, don't duplicate these identity files to avoid interfering with your production node's peering:

- **Bera-Reth**: `discovery_secret` file
- **Bera-Geth**: `nodekey` file
- **Beacon-Kit**: `priv_validator_key.json` file
  :::

1. Stop your current execution and consensus clients.
2. Install Beacon-Kit and either Bera-Geth or Bera-Reth, linked below, into place.
3. Install the new consensus & execution genesis files linked below into place, and verify the hash with `md5sum <file>`.
   - **Beacon-Kit:** overwrite `$BEACOND_HOME/config/genesis.json`
   - **Bera-Reth:**, overwrite `$RETH_DATA/genesis.json`.
   - **Bera-Geth:** Run `bera-geth init` against your Geth data directory with the supplied genesis file.
     We recommend making this a permanent part of every `bera-geth` startup. Our recommended [startup process](https://github.com/berachain/guides/tree/main/apps/node-scripts/run-geth.sh) now includes this.

     `bera-geth init --datadir /geth/datadir eth-genesis.json`

4. Start all clients.

## FAQ

Where's my Bera-Geth data directory?

The geth `datadir` should contain the following directories:

```bash-vue{4-8}
tree datadir;

# [Expected Output]:
# datadir
# ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ keystore
# ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ geth
#     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ blobpool
#     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ chaindata
```
