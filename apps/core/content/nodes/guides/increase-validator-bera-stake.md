# Increase A Validator's $BERA Stake

The following steps will guide you through the process of increasing a Validator's `$BERA` stake to increase their stake weight and increase the probability of proposing blocks.

This guide assumes that a Validator is already in the Active Set.

If you would like to test this out locally, consult our guide to a [local Kurtosis-based devnet](/nodes/guides/kurtosis), which includes instructions on testing deposits.

## Active Set & $BERA Stake

Currently, the Active Set consists of `{{config.mainnet.validatorActiveSetSize}}` Validators, which is the number of Validators that can propose blocks.

The Active Set is determined by the amount of `$BERA` staked, where the top stakers are included in the Active Set. To be included in the Active Set, a Validator must stake at least {{config.mainnet.stakeMinimumIncrease}} `$BERA` or 1 `$BERA` more than the lowest staker in the Active Set (whichever is greater).

If a Validator is removed from the Active Set, all `$BERA` staked to that Validator will be returned to the Validator's Withdrawal Credentials Address.

## Staking Considerations

There are a few points to consider with staking:

- **Stake Returned To Single Address** - All `$BERA` staked to a Validator is returned to the Validator's Withdrawal Credentials Address. If there are multiple stakers, an agreement must be put in place with the Validator to ensure that the `$BERA` is returned to the correct addresses.
- **Liquid Staking Protocols** - Managing multiple stakers with a single Validator can be difficult. As an alternative, Liquid Staking Protocols are an option.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A Validator that is already in the Active Set
- A Validator's `pubkey` - PubKeys can be found at <a :href="config.mainnet.dapps.url + '/validators'" target="_blank">{{config.mainnet.dapps.hub.name}} Validators</a>
- A minimum of {{config.mainnet.stakeMinimumIncrease}} `$BERA` or 1 `$BERA` more than the lowest staker in the Active Set (whichever is greater)
