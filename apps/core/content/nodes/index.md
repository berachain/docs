# Berachain Node Architecture Overview üìì

Berachain's network relies on validator nodes and RPC nodes. Each can be configured as a full node or archive node.

Each of these types of nodes is a pair of both an [execution client](/learn/help/glossary#execution-client) and a [consensus client](/learn/help/glossary#consensus-client). Berachain is a Layer 1 EVM Identical chain, which means that for the execution layer, it supports any EVM execution client paired with a consensus client and framework built by Berachain called [BeaconKit](/nodes/beaconkit-consensus).

## RPC vs Validator Nodes üì°

The main difference between an RPC node and a validator node is that a validator can propose blocks and receive block rewards.

An RPC node can become a validator node by joining the [Active Set](#active-set-‚úÖ) through interaction with the [`BeaconDeposit`](/developers/contracts/beacondeposit) contract by meeting the `$BERA` [stake requirements](#validator-stake-requirements-üîë).

## Active Set ‚úÖ

The active set is the set of validators that are currently participating in the consensus layer of the network.

The current limit of validators in the active set is `{{config.mainnet.validatorActiveSetSize}}`.

Validators can choose to leave the active set voluntarily ‚Äî [learn how](/nodes/guides/withdraw-stake) ‚Äî or be ejected from the set if the active set if a validator with more stake joins the active set.

## Validator Stake Requirements üîë

The minimum stake requirement depends on whether the active set is completely full.

If the active set is not full, the minimum stake requirement is `{{config.mainnet.validatorDepositAmount.toLocaleString()}}` `$BERA`.

If the active set is full, the minimum stake requirement is `10,000` `$BERA` more than the amount staked by the last validator in the active set.

It can take up to `{{config.mainnet.validatorActivationEpochDelay}}` epochs (`{{config.mainnet.blocksPerEpoch}}` blocks per epoch) for deposits to be processed and for a validator to be included in the active set.

## Direct Staking

Berachain follows Proof-of-Stake (PoS) direct staking, which allows `$BERA` holders to directly stake their `$BERA` to a validator. However, note that if funds are withdrawn from a validator, currently all funds are returned to a single address: the validator's Withdrawal Credentials Address.

This means that validators will have to communicate how they handle funds when a validator is removed from the active set.

:::warning
Avoid staking to validators without knowing how they handle funds when a validator is removed from the active set.
:::

## Removed From Active Set ‚ùå

If a validator is removed from the active set, all `$BERA` staked to that validator will be returned to the validator's Withdrawal Credentials Address, which is set when the validator makes their first deposit.

A validator can decide to become a validator again but will need to generate new CometBFT validator keys and start the deposit process again as if they were a new validator.

:::warning
Staking with a previously-used CometBFT identity ‚Äî a validator that was removed from the active set ‚Äî will result in the funds being returned to that validator's withdrawal address at the end of the current epoch. The validator can never be re-activated.
:::

## Voluntary Withdrawals ‚ö†Ô∏è

A Validator can [withdraw all or part of their stake](/nodes/guides/withdraw-stake).

## Validator Block Rewards & Distribution ü™ô

Block rewards are in the form of `$BGT`, with a base reward of `{{config.mainnet.validatorBaseBGTReward}}` `$BGT` per block proposed.

Rewards are not distributed automatically and require that the block rewards be distributed via the [`Distributor`](/developers/contracts/distributor) contract. Distribution must occur before `{{config.mainnet.rewardDistributionTimeExpiration}}` seconds have passed, or validators risk losing those rewards.
