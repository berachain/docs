# Claims API

The Claims API provides endpoints for learning about available reward distributions, providing proofs on demand, and aggregated.  This API is useful for developers in the Proof of Liquidity ecosystem.

## Base URL

The base URL for the API endpoints depends on which network you're interacting with:

- **Testnet (Bepolia)**: `https://bepolia.claim-api.berachain.com`
- **Mainnet**: `https://claim-api.berachain.com`

## Rate Limiting and Caching

All endpoints are rate-limited to prevent abuse. Responses are also cached for optimal performance. If you receive a rate limit error, please wait before retrying your request or reconsider your software design. 

## Merkle Proofs

The Claims API uses Merkle proofs to verify reward eligibility. These proofs are cryptographic evidence that a particular wallet address is entitled to specific rewards from a distribution.

### What are Merkle Proofs?

Merkle proofs are a cryptographic method that allows for efficient and secure verification of data within a larger dataset without requiring the entire dataset. In the context of reward distributions:

1. Each distribution creates a Merkle tree containing all eligible wallet addresses and their corresponding rewards
2. When a wallet requests their rewards, the API provides a Merkle proof that cryptographically verifies their inclusion in the distribution
3. This proof can be submitted on-chain to claim the rewards

### Using Merkle Proofs

When you receive a Merkle proof from the API:

1. Store the proof data securely
2. Submit the proof to the (FIXME which) smart contract when claiming rewards
3. The contract will verify the proof's validity before releasing the rewards


## Examples

Here's an example of how to fetch rewards for a wallet using curl:

```bash
curl https://bepolia.claim-api.berachain.com/api/v1/wallets/0x1234.../rewards
```

For JavaScript/TypeScript applications:

```typescript
const response = await fetch('https://bepolia.claim-api.berachain.com/api/v1/wallets/0x1234.../rewards');
const data = await response.json();
```

## Endpoints

### Health Check

```http
GET /health
```

```

#### Get Wallet Rewards

```http
GET /api/v1/wallets/{wallet}/rewards
```

Retrieve all rewards for a specific wallet.

**Parameters**
- `wallet` (path): The wallet address

**Response**
```json
// FIXME: Add example response showing:
// - Total rewards
// - Breakdown by validator
// - Claim status
// - Timestamps
```

#### Get Aggregated Unclaimed Rewards

```http
GET /api/v1/wallets/{wallet}/rewards/aggregation
```

Retrieve aggregated unclaimed rewards grouped by validators for a wallet.

**Parameters**
- `wallet` (path): The wallet address

**Response**
```json
// FIXME: Add example response showing aggregated rewards structure:
// - Total unclaimed amount
// - Breakdown by validator
// - Time periods
```

#### Get Aggregated Unclaimed Rewards for Specific Validator

```http
GET /api/v1/wallets/{wallet}/rewards/aggregation/{validator}
```

Retrieve aggregated unclaimed rewards for a specific validator and wallet.

**Parameters**
- `wallet` (path): The wallet address
- `validator` (path): The validator address

**Response**
```json
// FIXME: Add example response showing detailed breakdown of unclaimed rewards
```

### Vault Operations

#### Get Vault BGT Rate

```http
GET /api/v1/vaults/{vault}/bgt-rate
```

Retrieve the expected BGT ingestion rate per block for a specific vault.

**Parameters**
- `vault` (path): The vault address

**Response**
```json
// FIXME: Add example response showing:
// - BGT rate per block
// - Any additional vault metrics
```


## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes:

- `200`: Success
- `400`: Bad Request
- `404`: Not Found
- `429`: Too Many Requests (Rate Limit Exceeded)
- `500`: Internal Server Error

Error responses will include a message explaining what went wrong:

```json
{
    "error": "Error message description"
}
```

Common error scenarios:
// FIXME: Document specific error cases for each endpoint, such as:
// - Invalid wallet address format
// - Non-existent validator
// - Invalid distribution ID
// - Missing proofs
// - System maintenance states
