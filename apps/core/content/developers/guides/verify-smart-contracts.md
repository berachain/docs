# Verify Smart Contracts

This guide demonstrates several options for verifying smart contracts on Berachain. Contract verification makes your source code publicly available and readable on block explorers, enhancing transparency and trust for users interacting with your contracts.

We'll cover the following verification methods:

- **Manual Verification using Berascan** - Step-by-step verification through the block explorer interface
- **Hardhat Verification** - Automated verification using Hardhat's built-in verification tools
- **Forge Verification** - Verification using Foundry's forge verify command
- **Remix Verification** - Verification directly from the Remix IDE

## Requirements

- An already deployed smart contract
- Access to the contract's source code
- Contract address on Berachain
- Appropriate verification tooling (depending on chosen method)

:::tip Need to deploy a contract first?
If you haven't deployed a contract yet, please refer to our [Create HelloWorld Contract Using Hardhat](/developers/guides/create-helloworld-contract-using-hardhat) or [Create ERC-20 Contract Using Foundry](/developers/guides/create-erc20-contract-using-foundry) guides first.
:::

## Manual Verification using Berascan

### Step 1 - Navigate to Your Contract

Go to your contract's page on Berascan using your contract address. You can find this by searching for your contract address in the search bar.

### Step 2 - Click "Verify and Publish"

On your contract page, look for the **"Verify and Publish"** link and click it.

![Verify Contract on Berascan](/assets/verify-contract-berascan.png)

This will take you to the contract verification page at [https://testnet.berascan.com/verifyContract](https://testnet.berascan.com/verifyContract).

### Step 3 - Enter Contract Details

On the verification page, you'll see a form to enter your contract details:

1. **Contract Address**: Enter your deployed contract address (pre-filled in the example)
2. **Compiler Type**: Select "Solidity (Single file)" for flattened contracts
3. **Compiler Version**: Choose the exact compiler version you used for deployment (e.g., v0.8.28+commit.7893614a)
4. **Open Source License Type**: Select the appropriate license (e.g., MIT License)
5. **Terms of Service**: Check the box to agree to the terms of service
6. **Continue**: Click the "Continue" button to proceed to the next step

![Contract Verification Form](/assets/contract-verification-steps.png)

:::tip Using Flattened Contract Files
For contracts with multiple files or dependencies, you can use a flattened contract file with a single file upload. This combines all dependencies into one file, making verification easier.
:::

### Step 4 - Upload Contract Source Code

After clicking "Continue", you'll reach the "Verify & Publish" stage where you upload your contract source code:

1. **Contract Details**: The page will display your contract address, compiler type (SINGLE FILE / CONCATENATED METHOD), and compiler version
2. **Source Code**: Paste your flattened contract source code in the text area
3. **Advanced Configuration**: Optionally configure optimization settings, runs, and EVM version
4. **Submit**: Click "Verify & Publish" to submit your contract for verification

![Contract Source Code Upload](/assets/contract-verification-step4.png)

:::info Contract Compilation Notes

- If your contract compiles correctly in Remix, it should also compile correctly here
- There's a timeout of up to 45 seconds for each contract compiled
- Limited support is available for contracts created by another contract
  :::

### Step 5 - Wait for Verification

After submission, Berascan will verify your contract. This process usually takes just a few seconds. Once verified, your contract will be publicly readable and you'll be able to interact with it directly through Berascan's interface.

![Contract Verification Success](/assets/contract-verification-success.png)

## Troubleshooting

If verification fails, check:

- Compiler version matches the one used for deployment
- Source code is complete and unmodified
- Constructor arguments are correct
- Contract address is valid

For additional help, refer to Berascan's verification documentation or contact their support team.

## Hardhat Verification

Hardhat provides built-in contract verification capabilities that can automatically verify your contracts after deployment. This method is ideal for developers using Hardhat as their development framework.

### Requirements

- Hardhat v3.0.0 or greater
- Etherscan API key (V2 API supports multiple platforms)
- Deployed contract with constructor arguments

### Configuration

First, add your Etherscan API key to Hardhat's keystore:

```bash
pnpm keystore:set ETHERSCAN_API_KEY
```

Next, configure your `hardhat.config.ts` to include verification settings:

```ts-vue
const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
  // ... other config
  verify: {
    etherscan: {
      apiKey: configVariable("ETHERSCAN_API_KEY"),
    },
  },
  chainDescriptors: {
    {{config.bepolia.chainId}}: {
      name: "{{config.bepolia.chainName}}",
      blockExplorers: {
        etherscan: {
          name: "{{config.bepolia.dapps.berascan.name}}",
          url: "{{config.bepolia.dapps.berascan.url}}",
          apiUrl: "{{config.bepolia.dapps.berascan.apiUrl}}",
        }
      }
    },
  }
};
```

### Verification Command

Add a verification script to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "verify:berachain": "./node_modules/.bin/hardhat verify --network berachainTestnet --"
  }
}
```

Then verify your contract:

```bash
# Replace with your contract address and constructor arguments
pnpm verify:berachain 0x2ACD9577B57Ff043F0203730683e8c7C881DcB21 "Hello World"
```

### Expected Output

```bash-vue
=== Etherscan ===
üì§ Submitted source code for verification on Berascan:
  contracts/HelloWorld.sol:HelloWorld
  Address: 0x2ACD9577B57Ff043F0203730683e8c7C881DcB21

‚è≥ Waiting for verification result...

‚úÖ Contract verified successfully on Berascan!
  contracts/HelloWorld.sol:HelloWorld

## Forge Verification

Foundry's `forge verify-contract` command provides a streamlined way to verify contracts directly from the command line. This method is perfect for developers using Foundry as their development framework.

### Requirements

- Foundry v1.3.1 or greater (required for Etherscan V2 API)
- Etherscan API key
- Deployed contract

### Verification Command

```bash-vue
forge verify-contract \
  --watch \
  --chain {{config.bepolia.dapps.berascan.chainName}} \
  <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> \
  src/YourContract.sol:YourContract \
  --verifier etherscan \
  --etherscan-api-key <YOUR_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY>
```

### Expected Output

```bash-vue
Start verifying contract `0xYOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` deployed on {{config.bepolia.dapps.berascan.chainName}}

Submitting verification for [src/BingBongToken.sol:BingBongToken] 0xYOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS.
Submitted contract for verification:
        Response: `OK`
        GUID: `xtecz3j...`
        URL: {{config.bepolia.dapps.berascan.url}}address/0xYOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS

## Remix Verification

Remix IDE provides a dedicated Contract Verification plugin that supports Berachain's block explorers. This method is ideal for developers who prefer a visual interface for contract verification.

### Requirements

- Contract deployed on Berachain (public network)
- Contract compiled in Remix IDE
- Constructor parameters (if required during deployment)
- Etherscan API key (for Berascan verification)

### Accessing the Plugin

1. **Open Remix IDE**: Navigate to [remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org)
2. **Enable Plugin**: Go to Plugin Manager and enable the "CONTRACT VERIFICATION" plugin
3. **Navigate to Plugin**: Access the Contract Verification plugin from the sidebar

### Verification Services

For Berachain, the plugin supports:

- **Berascan** (Etherscan-based, requires API key)
- **Beratrail** (Routescan-based, enabled by default)

### Verification Process

1. **Compile Contract**: Ensure your contract is compiled in Remix
2. **Select Services**: Choose which verification services to use (Beratrail is enabled by default, Berascan requires API key)
3. **Enter Contract Address**: Input the deployed contract address
4. **Constructor Arguments**: If your contract has constructor parameters, enter them in the provided text box
5. **Submit Verification**: Click verify to submit your contract for verification

### Advanced Features

#### Proxy Contract Verification

For contracts behind a proxy:

1. Check "The deployed contract is behind a proxy" checkbox
2. Provide the proxy contract address
3. The plugin will verify both the implementation and proxy contracts

:::info Proxy Limitations
Proxy verification is only supported on Berascan (Etherscan-based service).
:::

#### Settings Configuration

Configure verification services in the Settings page:

- Add Etherscan API keys (mandatory for Berascan verification)
- Configure custom API URLs for verification services
- Settings are stored per chain

:::tip Etherscan V2 API
Remix uses the Etherscan V2 API, meaning the same API key works across 50+ different chains, including Berachain for Berascan verification.
