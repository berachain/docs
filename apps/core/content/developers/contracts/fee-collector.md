The Fee Collector contract is responsible for collecting fees from Berachain Dapps and
auctioning them for a Payout token which then is distributed among the BGT stakers.

This contract is inspired by the [Uniswap V3 Factory Owner contract](https://github.com/uniswapfoundation/UniStaker/blob/main/src/V3FactoryOwner.sol).
