## Check $BERA Airdrop üîç

The airdrop checker is a tool to let you learn your allocation on launch day. Your genesis allocation from testnet use, testnet user RFA allocations, and ecosystem NFTs is already in your wallet.

You can check your allocations in two ways:

- Enter your address
- Connect relevant socials

You will be able to see your tokens available to claim on launch.

The checker reads NFT token allocations from official Bera NFTs on Ethereum mainnet. Recipients of the social airdrop and RFB must use social login, then tie their allocations to a wallet. RFB and social airdrop claims will be distributed on Feb 10th.
