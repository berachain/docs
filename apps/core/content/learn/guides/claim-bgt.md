# Claim BGT Rewards Guide üéÅ

When you stake tokens in Reward Vaults, you earn BGT rewards based on validator emissions. This guide shows you how to claim those rewards, including new options for claiming partial amounts.

::: tip For Developers
If you're building applications that integrate BGT claiming functionality, see our [developer guides for implementing partial reward claims](/developers/guides/partial-reward-claims) and [staking for other accounts](/developers/guides/staking-for-other-accounts).
:::

## Overview

BGT rewards accumulate in Reward Vaults as validators direct emissions to them. You can claim these rewards in two ways:

- **Full Claim**: Claim all your accumulated BGT at once
- **Partial Claim**: Claim specific amounts, leaving the rest to accumulate (coming thoon)

## How to Claim BGT Rewards

**Via Berachain Hub:**

1. Navigate to [hub.berachain.com](https://hub.berachain.com)
2. Go to the **Stake** section
3. Find your staked positions
4. Click **"Claim Rewards"** to claim all accumulated BGT
5. Confirm the transaction

**What happens:**

- All your accumulated BGT is claimed to your wallet
- Your reward balance resets to zero
- You continue earning new rewards on your staked position

### Protocol Claiming

You can authorize protocols to claim your BGT rewards on your behalf, enabling automated reward management. This requires setting the protocol as your "operator."

**What Operators Can Do:**

- Claim your BGT rewards (full or partial amounts)
- Send rewards to specified addresses
- Execute pre-approved claiming strategies

**What Operators Cannot Do:**

- Cannot withdraw your staked tokens
- Cannot change your staking positions
- Cannot access other wallet functions

**Common Use Cases:**

- **Automated DeFi strategies**: Protocol claims BGT and reinvests into other opportunities
- **Dollar-cost averaging**: Regular small claims to smooth market volatility
- **Streaming rewards**: Gradual claiming over time for tax or liquidity management

::: tip For Developers
See the [staking for other accounts guide](/developers/guides/staking-for-other-accounts) and [partial reward claims guide](/developers/guides/partial-reward-claims) for implementation details.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No rewards to claim"**

- Your vault may not have received validator emissions recently
- Check if your staking position is active
- Verify you're connected to the correct wallet

**"Transaction failed"**

- You may be trying to claim more than your available balance
- Check gas limits and network congestion
- Ensure your wallet has enough BERA for gas fees
