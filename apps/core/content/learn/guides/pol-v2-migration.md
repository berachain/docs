# PoL V2 Migration Guide üîÑ

PoL V2 brings the BERA Yield Module, giving `$BERA` holders direct yield opportunities while keeping the existing Proof-of-Liquidity ecosystem intact. This guide walks you through what's new, what changes, and what stays the same.

## Technical Migration Details

### Contract Addresses

| Contract | Address | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| WBERAStakerVault | `0x...` | TBD |
| BGTIncentiveFeeCollector | `0x...` | TBD |
| BGTIncentiveFeeDeployer | `0x...` | TBD |

### Configuration Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Incentive Fee Rate | 33% | Percentage of incentives redirected |
| Withdrawal Cooldown | 7 days | Unbonding period for withdrawals |
| Initial Deposit | 10 WBERA | Inflation attack protection |

### Backward Compatibility

- **Existing contracts**: All existing PoL contracts keep working
- **API compatibility**: No breaking changes to existing integrations
- **User experience**: Existing workflows stay the same

## Risk Considerations

### Smart Contract Risk
- **Audited contracts**: Thorough security review completed
- **Emergency controls**: Pausable contracts with role-based access
- **Gradual rollout**: Initial deployment with conservative parameters

### Economic Risk
- **Incentive reduction**: BGT holders get 67% of previous incentives
- **Market impact**: BERA price might go up from increased utility
- **Yield variability**: Returns depend on protocol incentive volume

### Operational Risk
- **Withdrawal delays**: 7-day unbonding period can't be skipped
- **Governance dependency**: Fee rates can be adjusted by governance
- **Technical complexity**: New contracts add some system complexity

## Best Practices

### For BERA Holders
- **Start small**: Begin with a small stake to understand the process
- **Plan withdrawals**: Remember the 7-day unbonding period
- **Monitor yield**: Keep track of how your position performs over time

### For BGT Holders
- **Assess impact**: Understand how incentive reduction affects your returns
- **Consider diversification**: Balance BGT and BERA positions
- **Stay informed**: Keep up with governance proposals for parameter changes

### For Protocols
- **Monitor costs**: Track how incentive fees affect your operations
- **Optimize strategies**: Consider adjusting incentive rates for efficiency
- **Engage governance**: Join discussions about fee rate adjustments

## FAQ

### Will my existing BGT rewards be affected?

Yes, BGT holders will get about 67% of previous incentive amounts, with 33% going to BERA stakers.

### Can I still earn BGT through Reward Vaults?

Yes, all existing Reward Vault functionality stays the same. You'll keep earning BGT as before.

### Is the 7-day unbonding period permanent?

The unbonding period is designed to encourage long-term alignment. It can be adjusted by governance if needed.

### What happens to existing BERA validator stakes?

Traditional BERA validator staking is completely unaffected. This is just an additional staking option.

### Can I stake both BERA and BGT?

Yes! You can participate in both systems at the same time for maximum yield opportunities.

### How is the incentive fee rate determined?

The fee rate is set by governance and can be adjusted based on ecosystem needs and market conditions.
