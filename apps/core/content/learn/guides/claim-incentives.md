## Claiming Incentives for Other Addresses

You can claim incentive tokens on behalf of other addresses using BeraHub's account override feature. This is particularly useful for managing multiple accounts or helping others claim their rewards.

For detailed instructions on using the account override feature, see the [Account Overriding section](/learn/dapps/berahub#account-overriding) in the BeraHub documentation.
