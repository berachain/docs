# Reward Vault Governance

While creating a [Reward Vault](/learn/pol/rewardvaults) is permissionless, they must be whitelisted through governance proposals to receive `$BGT` emissions from validators. This process ensures community oversight and alignment over projects joining the Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) ecosystem.

## Request for Reward Vault

:::tip Submission Process
The Reward Vault whitelisting process involves submitting a **Request for Reward Vault** (RFRV) form **AND** on the [Governance Forum](https://hub.forum.berachain.com/c/reward-vaults/6).
:::
There are two types of RFRVs:

1. **BEX Pool RFRVs**: For token pairs trading on BEX
2. **General (non-BEX) RFRVs**: For other protocol integrations

### 1. BEX Pool RFRVs ([Form](https://tinyurl.com/bdebbjkb))
