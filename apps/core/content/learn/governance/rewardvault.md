# Reward Vault Governance

While creating a [Reward Vault](/learn/pol/rewardvaults) is permissionless, they must be whitelisted through governance proposals to receive `$BGT` emissions from validators. This process ensures community oversight and alignment over projects joining the Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) ecosystem.

## Request for Reward Vault

:::tip Submission Process
The Reward Vault whitelisting process involves 1) submitting a **Request for Reward Vault** (RFRV) form **AND** 2) posting on the [Governance Forum](https://hub.forum.berachain.com/c/reward-vaults/6).
:::
There are two types of RFRVs - ensure you complete the appropriate form based on your use case: **BEX Pool RFRVs** (For token pairs trading on BEX) and **General (non-BEX) RFRVs** (For other protocol integrations).
