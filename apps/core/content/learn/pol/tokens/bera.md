`$BERA` serves as the native gas and staking token of Berachain, the first blockchain powered by Proof-of-Liquidity.

## Role of BERA

The `$BERA` token serves two main purposes on the Berachain network:

### Transaction Fees

`$BERA` is used to pay for transactions on the Berachain network (hence its designation as the "gas token"). Tokens used for transaction fees are burned, removing them from the circulating supply.

### Validator Staking

Validators stake `$BERA` to operate a validator. Within the active set, the more `$BERA` a validator has staked, the more frequently they are chosen to propose blocks. A validator's probability of block production is directly proportional to their share of the total staked `$BERA`. The economic value of all staked `$BERA` tokens forms the economic security of the chain, with [$BGT](/learn/pol/tokens/bgt) dynamics controlling its inflation.

To learn more about how `$BERA` staking affects block production and emissions, see [Block Rewards](/learn/pol/blockrewards.md).
