The `$BERA` token serves two main purposes on the Berachain network:

1. Paying for transactions on the blockchain ($BERA also referred to as the "gas token")
2. Staking for activating validator nodes. Validators have to stake 250K to 2.5M BERA to spin up a validator. Within the active set, the more `$BERA` a validator has staked, the more frequently they are chosen to propose blocks. The economic value of all `$BERA` tokens staked adds up to form the base layer the security of the chain with [`$BGT`](/learn/pol/tokens/bgt) building on-top of it for enhanced security.

To learn more about how `$BERA` staking affects block production, check out the docs on [block production](../bgtmath.md).
