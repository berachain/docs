## Distribution and Allocation

The total genesis supply of 500 million `$BERA` is allocated across five categories:

![BERA Allocation](/assets/bera-allocation.png)

#### Initial Core Contributors - 84,000,000 (16.8%)

Tokens distributed to advisors and members of Big Bera Labs, the core contributors to the Berachain blockchain.

#### Investors - 171,500,000 (34.3%)

Tokens distributed to Berachainâ€™s Seed, Series A and Series B investors.

#### Community Allocations

Berachain's growth to date is largely driven by an unparalleled community and a massive developer ecosystem leveraging Proof of Liquidity to power the next generation of applications. The community allocation (**244,500,000** `$BERA` total, or 48.9% of supply) is broken down across three key areas:

##### Airdrop - 79,000,000 (15.8%)

15.8% of Berachain's token supply will be distributed through airdrops, recognizing a variety of parties within the Berachain ecosystem, including testnet users, Berachain NFT holders, ecosystem NFT holders, social supporters, ecosystem dApps, community builders and more. For more information on the airdrop breakdown, please visit the [Blog](https://blog.berachain.com/blog/berachain-airdrop-update).

##### Future Community Initiatives - 65,500,000 (13.1%)

13.1% of Berachain's token supply will be dedicated to applications, developers and users through incentive programs, grants and more, with input from the community itself via Snapshots, RFPs etc.

##### Ecosystem & R&D - 100,000,000 (20%)

20% of Berachain's token supply will be used to support ecosystem development, R&D, growth initiatives, and the operations of the Berachain Foundation. This will largely focus on programs for developers and builders (see [Boyco](https://boyco.berachain.com/)), node operator delegations, and evolutions of Proof-of-Liquidity and BeaconKit.

_At launch, 9.5% of `$BERA` supply is unlocked from this bucket for ecosystem growth, developer tooling / infrastructure, liquidity provisioning and more._

## Token Release Schedule

All parties follow an identical vesting schedule:

- Initial Unlock: After a one-year cliff, 1/6th of allocated tokens are unlocked
- Linear Vesting: The remaining 5/6ths of tokens vest linearly over the subsequent 24 months
