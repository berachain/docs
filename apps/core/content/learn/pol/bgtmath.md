# Block Production and Emissions

## Overview

Proof of Liquidity governs block production and token emissions on Berachain. This page explains the mathematical principles behind validator selection, block rewards, and emissions calculations.

## Validator Selection

The network maintains an active set of N validators who are eligible for block production. Selection criteria include:

- Only top N validators by BERA stake are included in active set
- Block proposal probability is proportional to staked BERA and does not affect reward amounts
- Stake limitations per validator:
  - Minimum: 250,000 BERA
  - Maximum: 2,500,000 BERA

## BGT Emissions Structure

When a validator produces a block, BGT tokens are emitted through two emission components, which is variable based on the validator's boost:

1. Base Emission

   - Fixed amount equal to a `base rate` parameter (B)
   - Paid directly to block-producing validator

2. Reward Emission

   - Variable amount dependent on validator's boost (x)
   - Distributed to [reward vaults](/learn/pol/rewardvaults) selected by validator
     - Proportional to reward vault weights in reward allocation

## Validator Boosts

Boost is a crucial metric that determines a validator's reward emissions:

- Calculated as the percentage of BGT delegation a validator has compared to the total BGT delegated in the network
- Expressed as a decimal between 0 and 1
- Example: If a validator has 1000 BGT delegated and the network has 10000 total BGT delegated, their boost would be 0.1 (10%)
  Higher boost leads to higher reward emissions, subject to the emission formula

## BGT Emissions Per Block

The total BGT emitted per block is calculated using the following formula:

$$emission = \left[B + \max\left(m, (a + 1)\left(1 - \frac{1}{1 + ax^b}\right)R\right)\right]$$

Where:

- x = validator's boost (range: [0,1])
- boost = percentage of BGT boosted to a given validator relative to total BGT boosted in the system

### Parameters

| Parameter                       | Description                                | Impact                                         |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| B (base rate)                   | Fixed amount of 1 BGT for block production | Determines baseline validator rewards          |
| R (reward rate)                 | Base BGT amount for reward vaults          | Sets foundation for reward emissions           |
| a (boost multiplier)            | Boost impact coefficient                   | Higher values increase boost importance        |
| b (convexity parameter)         | Boost impact curve steepness               | Higher values penalize low boost more severely |
| m (minimum boosted reward rate) | Floor for reward vault emissions           | Higher values benefit low-boost validators     |

### Sample Emissions Chart

Using the following sample parameters, we can visualize how emissions scale with BGT delegation:
$$B = 0.5, R = 1.5, a = 3.5, b = 0.4, m = 0$$

## Max Block Inflation

BGT emissions grow with the amount of boost a validator has, up to a cap. The Maximum theoretical block emission occurs at 100% boost:
$$\max \mathbb{E}[\text{emission}] = \left[B + \max(m, aR)\right]$$
