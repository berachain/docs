# Proof-of-Liquidity Frequently Asked Questions ❓

## Validator Requirements & Operations

### Can anyone stake $BERA to become a validator?

While anyone can stake $BERA to try to become a validator in the active set, there are specific staking requirements:

There is a minimum floor of 250K $BERA required to be a validator. There is a maximum cap of 2.5M $BERA for any validator's stake. Only the top N validators (ordered by $BERA staked) can be in the active validator set. Even if someone stakes above the minimum 250K $BERA, they would still need to have enough stake to be within the top N validators to be part of the active validator set that can produce blocks.

### Can validators with no $BGT delegated to them build blocks and earn rewards?

The ability to build blocks is determined by $BERA stake, not $BGT delegation. As long as a validator has enough $BERA staked and is in the active set, they can produce blocks regardless of how much $BGT is delegated to them. For every block a validator proposes, that validator recieves a reward.

### Is there a cap for the number of active validators?

There will be a mechanism for capping validators to a safe level. The validators in this cap are known as the 'active set.'

## dApps & Reward Vaults

### Can dApps that don't have a token still participate in PoL?

Yes, a fundamental aspect of Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) is the use of whitelisted Reward Vaults. A protocol only needs to issue a receipt token that can be staked in the protocol's respective whitelisted Reward Vault. The receipt token is different from a native token and can be thought of as a form of bookkeeping token. For example, when a user provides liquidity to a BEX pool, they receive a receipt token in the form of an LP token. That LP token can be staked with a Reward Vault to earn $BGT from emissions directed from validators.

### Are there restrictions on what kinds of dApps can have whitelisted Reward Vaults?

No, any dApp can deploy a Reward Vault and submit it as a governance proposal to have it whitelisted.

### Are rewards vaults created only by whitelisting governance proposals?

Technically, the creation of rewards vaults is permissionless, but for validators to direct $BGT emissions to those rewards vaults, a governance proposal for whitelisting the rewards vault must pass.

### Do native dApps have an advantage over non-native dApps that participate in PoL?

All rewards vaults are treated equally and is determined solely by validators distributing rewards to Reward Vaults. The only exception would be that if a Validator does not specify their Reward Allocation, native dApps are set as default Reward Vaults for Reward Allocation for validators.

## Rewards and Emissions

### How much $BGT could any given reward vault earn?

The amount of $BGT a given reward vault can earn is a function of following:

1. How many validators are directing emissions to those vaults
2. How much $BGT is delegated to the validators directing emissions to those vaults

### Is the size of the $BGT emission linear to the amount of $BGT delegated to a validator?

No, the $BGT emission is not linear to the amount of $BGT delegated to a validator. The emission formula is:
$$emission = B + max(m, \frac{a + 1}{1 + ax^b} - 1R)$$
Where x is the boost (the percentage of $BGT delegation the validator has out of total $BGT delegated). The relationship between boost and emissions is governed by two parameters:
a (boost multiplier): determines impact of boost on emissions
b (convexity parameter): determines how quickly boost impacts emissions

### How does Berachain manage hyperinflation of $BGT?

The inflation of $BGT is equivalent to traditional PoS systems having some percentage of inflation per year. Berachain just takes that PoS inflation and distributes it between a validator and reward vaults.

The end result is that the inflation cadence should effectively mirror an equivalent PoS platform, it's just allocated in a manner that better aligns the interests of validators, protocols and users.

### Why are Incentive emissions defined per $BGT instead of being pool-based?

Incentives are denominated in $BGT– ultimately users, validators, and protocols want to be able to calculate per $BGT they're earning, so it's more of a choice of UI to facilitate understanding the value $BGT drives.

### Can only validators vote on or create governance proposals?

Anyone who holds enough $BGT can vote on proposals. Anyone who meets the threshold of 1000 $BGT can create a proposal.
