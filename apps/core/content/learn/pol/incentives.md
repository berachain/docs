# Incentive Marketplace

## Overview

Berachain's incentive marketplace enables protocols to bid for validator emissions using whitelisted incentive tokens. In doing so, protocols incentivize user of their protocol with `$BGT` rewards.

Validators can direct emissions to protocols' pools through reward vaults, collecting these incentives in return. Validators are expected to redistribute received incentives to their `$BGT` delegators.

## Reward Vault Whitelisting

Protocols must complete these steps to whitelist a reward vault:

1. Deploy vault through factory contract

   - Specify single staking token
   - One vault per staking token allowed

2. Submit governance proposal for whitelisting

3. Upon approval, vault becomes eligible for emissions

## Token Whitelisting

To whitelist an incentive token:

1. Submit governance proposal containing:
   - Token address
   - Minimum incentive rate - Lowest allowed exchange rate between protocol token and BGT
     - Ensures fair exchange for BGT emissions
     - Token managers cannot set incentive rates below this floor
   - Token manager address - Account that will control incentive parameters
2. Note:
   - Each vault maintains separate whitelisted tokens
   - Tokens can be removed via governance
   - Token managers can be updated through governance

## Incentive Marketplace Operations

### Incentive Management

Token managers are the only ones entitled to add incentive tokens and control incentive parameters:

- Set incentive rate (p)
- Example: Setting rate p=10 means:
  - 10 protocol tokens exchanged per 1 BGT
  - 1000 incentive tokens deposited enables 100 BGT worth of emissions flowing to vault

### Rate Adjustments

Rate modifications follow these rules:

1. Empty vault:
   Can update to any rate
   $$r \geq r_{min}$$

2. Non-empty vault:
   Can only increase rate
   $$p^* > p$$
   Cannot decrease rate until vault incentives deplete (reverting to scenario #1)

### Distribution Flow

1. Validator emits BGT to protocol vault
2. Validator receives (p Ã— BGT) protocol tokens
3. Validator expected to share portion with delegates
4. Creates alignment between validators, protocols, and users
