# PoL Participants üë•

The following diagram shows a breakdown of the different participants in the PoL ecosystem.

## Validators ‚úÖ

Validators coordinate with one another to reach consensus on the state of the blockchain. The active validator set consists of the top N validators ordered by BERA staked, with a 250K floor and 2.5M BERA cap per validator. Validators earn through three primary means:

1. Gas fees and priority fees
2. Collecting incentives provided by protocols for directing BGT rewards to their [Reward Vaults](/learn/pol/rewardvaults)
3. A base block reward (in BGT) for successfully proposing a block

### Validator Incentives üíé

When a validator directs BGT emissions to a reward vault, they receive protocol-supplied incentives provided to attract these emissions (thus increasing the attractiveness of depositing into that protocol). These Incentives can be in the form of the protocol's native token or any other whitelisted ERC20 token.

Here's how Incentives work:

1. A protocol sets an incentive rate for their reward vault (e.g., 10 protocol tokens per 1 BGT)
2. When a validator directs BGT emissions to this vault, they receive the corresponding amount of Incentives (e.g. 10 protocol tokens for directing 1 BGT)
3. Validators can take a commission on these Incentives before distributing the remainder to their BGT delegators
4. The amount of BGT a validator can direct (and thus Incentives they can earn) depends on their delegation weight

Protocols compete for BGT emissions by offering attractive Incentive rates in their reward vaults, creating a marketplace where validators can optimize their returns by choosing the most profitable vaults.

### Ecosystem Alignment ‚öñÔ∏è

Successful validators in PoL optimize for:

- Securing BGT delegation to increase their block rewards
- Efficiently exchanging BGT block rewards for protocol incentives
- Distributing value back to their BGT delegators

## BGT Holders & Farmers ü•ï

BGT holders play crucial roles in:

- Voting on governance proposals
- Influencing economic incentives through delegation
- Staking in reward vaults to earn more BGT

::: tip
BGT that is delegated to validators is not subject to slashing. Only validators' BERA stakes can be slashed.

### Earning BGT ‚¨áÔ∏è

Users can earn BGT by staking PoL-eligible receipt tokens in reward vaults. These receipt tokens are generated by performing actions that benefit the network, such as providing liquidity to a BEX pool.

### Delegating BGT ‚¨ÜÔ∏è

When delegating BGT, users typically consider:

- Which reward vaults validators direct emissions to
- Validator commission rates and incentive distribution strategies
- Validator uptime and performance

## Ecosystem Projects üß∏

Projects can participate in PoL by:

1. Creating a reward vault through the factory contract
2. Submitting a governance proposal to whitelist the vault
3. Specifying accepted staking tokens and incentive rates
4. Managing incentive tokens and rates in their vault

The [incentives marketplace](/learn/pol/incentives) allows protocols to bid for validators' emissions using whitelisted tokens, creating alignment between validators, protocols, and users. Projects must earn favor of BGT holders to have their Reward Vaults whitelisted into the PoL system.

This ecosystem alignment ensures that chain participants are incentivized to increase the overall value of the network, as rewards center around BGT while maintaining chain security through BERA staking.
