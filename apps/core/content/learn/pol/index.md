# Proof-of-Liquidity Overview üìì

Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) is an extension of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) that realigns economic incentives among validators, applications, and users. This is enabled through a two-token model - a token responsible for chain security (`$BERA`) and a token responsible for governance and rewards (`$BGT`).

## Core Components

### Security Layer ($BERA)

Berachain's Active Set of validators (validators participating in consensus) is determined by validators' `$BERA` stake, with a minimum of `{{ config.mainnet.minEffectiveBalance }} $BERA` and a maximum cap of `{{ config.mainnet.maxEffectiveBalance }} $BERA`. The top {{ config.mainnet.validatorActiveSetSize }} validators ranked by stake are in the Active Set. Within the Active Set, a validator's probability of proposing a block is proportional to their staked `$BERA` ‚Äî more `$BERA` staked increases the likelihood of proposing a block.

### Reward Layer ($BGT)

The size of a validator's `$BGT` block reward is determined by their Boost, which is a percentage calculated from the validator's `$BGT` boost divided by the total `$BGT` boosted to all validators. Boosts are obtained when `$BGT` holders delegate to validators.

Learn more about how emissions are calculated on the [emissions page](./blockrewards.md).

## PoL Lifecycle

### 1. Validator Lifecycle

The journey begins when a Prospective Validator stakes their `$BERA` as a security bond (‚ë†). Validators are chosen to propose blocks with a probability proportional to their staked amount (‚ë°). For each block proposed, the validator receives both a base emission and a variable reward emission based on their boost percentage (‚ë¢) (see [emissions](./blockrewards.md)).

### 2. Block Reward Distribution

After collecting the base `$BGT` rewards for themselves, validators direct the remaining variable `$BGT` rewards to whitelisted [Reward Vaults](/learn/pol/rewardvaults) of their choosing (‚ë£). In exchange for directing their emissions, validators receive protocol-provided [Incentives](/learn/pol/incentives) from Reward Vaults (the `$BGT` is earned by users supplying liquidity to the protocol).

### 3. Liquidity Provider Flow

The ecosystem's liquidity providers (i.e., users) play a crucial role in PoL. Users can provide liquidity to protocols like BEX (‚ë§) and receive receipt tokens as proof of their contribution (‚ë•). These receipt tokens are then staked in Reward Vaults (‚ë¶), where users earn `$BGT` proportional to their share of the vault (‚ëß).

### 4. Delegation Cycle

As `$BGT` Holders accumulate tokens, they can delegate them to validators (‚ë®), directly influencing the validator's boost. This creates a virtuous cycle where higher delegation leads to increased validator boost, resulting in larger `$BGT` emissions when that validator proposes blocks. Validators are incentivized to share their received protocol Incentives with delegators to attract more boosts, fostering a collaborative ecosystem.

## Ecosystem Alignment ü§ù

By integrating Berachain's native network rewards among all ecosystem participants, PoL creates alignment between:

- **Validators**: Need `$BGT` delegation to maximize their block rewards and must efficiently direct emissions to reward vaults to earn Incentives and attract more boost.
- **Protocols**: Compete for `$BGT` emissions by offering attractive Incentive rates in their reward vaults
- **Users**: Earn `$BGT` by providing liquidity, then delegate to validators who maximize returns
