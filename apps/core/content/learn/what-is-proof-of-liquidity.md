# What is Proof-of-Liquidity? 🤝

Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) is a novel consensus mechanism that aligns and increases the security of the chain by increased liquidity deployed on chain.

PoL borrows from the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) concept of securing a chain by providing an initial stake with the native gas token. PoL builds upon PoS by introducing an additional soulbound governance token that both determines the potential reward weight for a staker, through delegation by others, and is rewarded to parties that have provided liquidity, or otherwise productive activity, to the chain through governed [Reward Vaults](./pol/rewardvaults.md).

This separates token responsibility for gas and security from tokens used to govern chain rewards.

For Berachain, that is the native gas token [`$BERA`](/learn/pol/tokens/bera), and the non-transferrable Berachain Governance Token ([`$BGT`](/learn/pol/tokens/bgt)).
