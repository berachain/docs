Berachain Berps is a decentralized leveraged trading platform which allows for perpetual futures contract trading.

Berachain's native stablecoin [`$HONEY`](/learn/pol/tokens/honey), serves as the base token for all trading collateral, payouts, and deposits. Users can passively earn by providing trading liquidity in the <a :href="config.websites.docsBerps.url + '/learn/vault/'">`$bHONEY` vault</a>. Vault depositors earn trading fees generated from Berps and serve as the counterparty to traders' positions.

In addition, the vault in Berps is an implementation of [Proof-of-Liquidity Reward Vaults](/learn/pol/rewardvaults) which allows stakers that deposit into the Reward Vault to become eligible to receive [`$BGT`](/learn/pol/tokens/bgt) emissions. This interaction demonstrates how PoL can incentivize users to take a variety of liquidity actions with dApps.
