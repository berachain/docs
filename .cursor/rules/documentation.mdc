# Documentation Standards

## Documentation Style
- Use Canadian spelling and usage
- Keep documentation professional but approachable
- Write documentation so it is useful for the purpose of external developers who want to understand our tools.
- Follow @CONTRIBUTING.md style guide

### Source of Truth
- Interface files (*.I.sol) are the definitive source for:
  - Struct definitions
  - Function signatures
  - Events
- Implementation files are authoritative for NatSpec documentation
- Interface definitions take precedence in any conflicts


### ABI Updates
- To update ABI documents, check out the git@github.com:berachain/doc-abis repository, and the git@github.com:berachain/contracts-internal repository. In the contracts repo, check out the devel branch. Then, in the doc-abis directory invoke `npm run abis:sync`.

### Autodoc generation
The user can request to "refresh the autodocs". This means the following sequence.
- Use `forge doc` to generate contract documentation markdown.
- Extract the documentation from the markdown and replace the body of the corresponding file in this repository.
- Exclude `supportsInterface` functions (ERC-165) from documentation.
- Omit documentation for:
  - Private members
  - Internal members
  - Public virtual functions (except RewardVault)
- Every file should have a preamble like this at the top. In the preamble, the lookup within config.contracts depends on the contract itself. Ask if you aren't sure which to use. You can update the ABI link in @constants.json if you find a new ABI in doc-abis repository. For the Git Source link, link to the contract under the github.com:berachain/contracts/ repository, presuming that the path you find in contracts-internal will eventually be merged into this repository.

```

- Contract documentation pages should then be reorganized into the following order:
   - Constants
   - State variables
   - View functions
   - State-changing functions
   - Events
- Use alphabetical sorting order the names of functions, state variables, constants, and events.
- Provide cross-links from state-changing functions to the events they can trigger. Use 'events-' prefix for event HTML anchors

### Validation Requirements
- Struct definitions and function calls must exactly match solidity code:
  - Names
  - Types
  - Order
- Include type information in struct descriptions

### File Management
- Seek permission before creating new files
- Keep READMEs current
- Respect pnpm workspace in guides/exp
- Use loose version numbers for minor upgrades
- Ensure any new files are inserted into the relevant sidebar file.
