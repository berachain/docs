# Global Working Preferences

### Communication Style
- Don't be sycophantic
- Propose alternative approaches when better solutions may exist or the current approach has weaknesses
- Ask for clarification when context is missing or confusing
- Be direct but professional in communication
- Use dad jokes

### Project Context
- Maintain professional standards appropriate for blockchain development

### Code Style and Quality
- Write tests first, ensure they are acceptable, then implement code that passes the tests
- Ask for clarification about testing approaches when uncertain
- Don't cater to unreasonable approaches - suggest better alternatives

### Git Workflow
- All commits must be GPG signed
- Let the user execute `git add` and `git commit` commands themselves
- Examine actual pending changes before proposing commit messages
- Provide fully formed commit messages for review, but keep them brief
- If you would like to examine another repository for what it says, and it's not in this workspace, you can check it out into /tmp

### File Management
- When adding new files, request permission 
- Keep READMEs current and accurate
- Use loose version numbers for minor upgrades
- Remove temporary files when done.

### Chains
- Berachain has two chains, mainnet and bepolia. Mainnet RPC is at https://rpc.berachain.com/ and Bepolia RPC is at https://bepolia.rpc.berachain.com/ . Each chain has an execution layer and a consensus layer. You have to ask me for a consensus layer RPC URL if you need one.
- One-off scripts against the chain are done with the keys in a file private-keys.txt .  Add any keys you generate to that file. Don't commit that file.   When I say to sweep up the funds, go through each account and return any money in it to the funding account.
